# Moment-based quantile sketches for aggregations

This repository contains code for the moment-based quantile sketch (Moments Sketch) as described in the [paper](http://www.vldb.org/pvldb/vol11/p1647-gan.pdf).

The maximum entropy solver and benchmarks can be found in `javamsketch/` directory, see the readme.md there for instructions on how to build and run the code.

The other directories contain supporting files for the paper.
